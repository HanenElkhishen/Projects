# Video Game Sales Statistical Analysis

## Project Overview
This project presents a **beginner-friendly statistical data analysis** of global video game sales.  
Using a publicly available video game sales dataset, the analysis explores how sales vary across **games, publishers, genres, platforms, and years**.

The primary goal is to apply **basic statistical reasoning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** techniques to uncover patterns and trends in the gaming industry. This type of analysis is important because it helps transform raw data into **meaningful business and market insights**, even with simple methods.

## Dataset Description
- **Dataset Name:** Video Game Sales (vgsales.csv)
- **Source:** Public dataset commonly used for data analysis practice
- **Description:**  
  The dataset contains historical sales data for video games across different regions.

### Key Features / Columns
- **Name:** Video game title  
- **Platform:** Gaming platform (e.g., PS, Xbox, Nintendo)  
- **Year:** Release year  
- **Genre:** Game genre (Action, Sports, RPG, etc.)  
- **Publisher:** Publishing company  
- **Global_Sales:** Total worldwide sales (in millions)

## Statistical Analysis Performed

### 1. Descriptive Statistics
- Identification of the **top-selling video game globally**
- Calculation of **total and average sales** across different categories

### 2. Distribution Analysis
- Sales distribution across:
  - Genres
  - Platforms
- Visualization of how sales are spread using bar charts

### 3. Comparative Analysis
- Comparison of **total global sales** by:
  - Publisher
  - Platform
  - Genre
- Identification of platforms with the **highest average sales**

### 4. Trend Analysis
- Examination of how **global video game sales changed over time**
- Aggregation of yearly sales to observe growth or decline patterns

### 5. Outlier Detection
- Boxplot analysis to check for **extreme values (outliers)** in global sales
- Helps understand whether a small number of games dominate the market

---

## Methodology
1. Load and inspect the dataset
2. Clean and group data using categorical variables
3. Apply aggregation functions (sum, mean)
4. Visualize results using simple plots
5. Interpret statistical outputs and trends

This approach emphasizes **clarity and statistical thinking**, rather than complex modeling.

## Key Insights & Findings
- A small number of games generate exceptionally high global sales
- Certain publishers consistently dominate total market sales
- Sales performance varies significantly by **platform and genre**
- Video game sales show noticeable changes across different years
- The presence of outliers highlights the **hit-driven nature** of the gaming industry

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **pandas** – data manipulation and aggregation  
- **matplotlib** – data visualization  

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **basic statistical analysis** can reveal valuable insights from real-world data.  
Despite its simplicity, the analysis highlights important market dynamics in the video game industry.

### Possible Extensions
- Deeper regional sales analysis (NA, EU, JP)
- Correlation analysis between genre, platform, and sales
- Time-series modeling for sales forecasting
- Data cleaning and normalization improvements
